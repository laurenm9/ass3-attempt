  <p>In this photo, I am in the center (playing middle). This game was the finals for our area. The school we were playing, was located right beside our highschool, so we had a big rivalry. They were predicted to win as they are a school almsot twice the size of ours. We ended up winning and moved on to WOSSA!</p>
